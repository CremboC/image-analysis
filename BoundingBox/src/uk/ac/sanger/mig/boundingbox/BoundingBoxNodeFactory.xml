	<name>Bounding Box</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Calculated a bounding box according to a threshold of pixels in a row/column,
		uses the centroid to simplify the calculation.
		The centroid can be calculated using the Image Features node provided in
		the KNIP (Image Processing) package.

		</intro>
		
		<option name="Return Type">
			Return either the original, input image and the calculated boundary box, or,
			return a modified image which contains the lines which represent the boundary box.
			Usually this is helpful when debugging. In general, the original return type should be 
			used as its more efficient.
		</option>

		<option name="Row Threshold">
			Number of pixels in a row which will be considered to be the boundary. Can
			either provide a single number, e.g. '150'
			which will be used for both upper and lower bound, or two separate
			numbers, e.g. '460,560' meaning '460' will be used
			for the upper boundary and '560' for the lower one.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Column Threshold">
			Number of pixels in a column which will be considered to be the boundary.
			Same as row threshold, can provide a single
			or two thresholds.
		</option>
